    <h4>Potential side-effects from chemotherapy</h4>

    <p>Imagine that you are a stage 2 colon cancer patient. For this group, it holds true that people may experience several
      problems after they had chemotherapy. The side effects can vary,
      depending on the drug or combination of them but the most common ones are nausea/vomitting,
      diarrhea, appetite loss, insomnia and fatique. Being a patient, you might experience all or
      some of them.</p>

    <p>Some side effects disappear quite quickly, but for some of them it can take months
    or years to disappear completely. While side effects can be unpleasant, they must
    be accessed against the need to reduce the chances of cancer reoccures. The visualization below might
    help you to imagine the amount of people suffering from the side effects.</p>

  </div>


<div class="animation">

  <h4>Compare the side-effects</h4>
          <p>Imagine that there are 100 people and some of them experience different side
            effects from chemotherapy. This visualization allows you to see how many people out of 100
             experience different side effects. Here icons of different
            colors represent different outcomes of the treatment. By pressing
           the button you can see animation presenting the risks of experiencing
           different side effects and compare them. The bigger
        the icon, the higher the risk is. You can also hover over the icon and
        see how many people experience this particular factor. </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Nausea/vomiting.</strong> When chemotherapy drugs enter the body, your
digestive system tries to get rid of them. Sometimes accute nausea and vomiting can be
experienced on the day of chemotherapy and sometimes several days after.
You would get the medicines to prevent vomiting but sometimes they fail. Refractory vomiting happens when
the medicamentations are given to you to prevent vomiting and nausea but they appear to not work.
This means that your nausea and vomiting have become refractory or no longer respond to the drugs you’re getting to prevent it.
Refractory vomiting may happen after a few or several chemotherapy treatments. </li>
<br>
<li><strong>Diarrhea.</strong> Diarrhea is the common side effect of chemotherapy. The
Abdominal cramping is an early sign that diarrhea is complicated and needs aggressive treatment.
Diahrrea leads to dehydration, which might cause hospitalization.
The severity of diahrrea might vary and in some cases raise up to 6 stools per day.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Appetite loss. </strong> Chemotherapy may affect your eating habbits
and cause appetite loss. This can lead to weight loss and depression. Other
things, such as trouble swallowing, pain, nausea, or vomiting can
decrease your appetite as well.  </li>
<br>
<li><strong>Insomnia.</strong> Sleep problems such as being unable to fall asleep and/or stay asleep,
also called insomnia, are common side effects of chemotherapy. Long-term insomnia might also
cause depression and icrease anxiety.</li>
<br>
<li><strong>Fatigue. </strong> The cancer related fatigue is different from the fatigue
in daily life. It can be described as feeling weak, listless, drained, or “washed out.”
Some people even feel tired to eat or go to the bathroom. Rest or sleep might not help and
any type of activity can be exhausting. You may feel week and low on energy and can't
concentrate or focus on things. This may also affect your work or social life. Most often
cancer related fatigue is provoked by anemia (low blood cell count), which is caused by
chemotherapy and cancer itself. If chemotherapy is given in cycles, fatigue will get worse
towards the later cycles.</li>
</ul>
